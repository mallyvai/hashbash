"""
So there's a bug in the autoconf/automake - one of the superdirectories had a space in it and completely screwed the makefile up
./libdieharder/rng_dev_urandom.c: * This is a wrapping of the /dev/random hardware rng

To list all rngs
	dieharder -g -1

trying to add my own tests by 
	1) copy-pasting libdieharder/rng_dev_urandom.c and modifying it
	2) adding my RNG to include/dieharder/dieharder_types.h with the following line: 
		GSL_VAR const gsl_rng_type *gsl_my_test_rng; /*!!!!!! test*/
	3) ./libdieharder/dieharder_types.c:    ADD(gsl_rng_dev_urandom);
