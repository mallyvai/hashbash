Everything is a combination of functions. No loops. No recursion. Just loops. Global variables allowed.

special functions: 
w(x,y) -> while(func, func) -> while loop\
pad_1(input, wanted_length).

functions take something and return something.



---------random idea-----------
an "offering line" that says "beyond a point, i will not offer this to my offspring
first 100 blocks in the generation are reserved for variables and the input.
input goes to 0. distinguish between constants and memory locations by saying "c" after a number.
-------------------------------
a breeding map that occupies some special range in memory that details lines to exclude in the breeding process.

---------------------------------
Since we have an integer placed pretty much everywhere, everything will "just work".

76 nand(0, 1)

guaranteed append a reduction operator at the end. might as well provide some special functions for this:
mod(1, num)
non-circular right shift(1, num)
XOR w/ some constant(1, num)

the generator should *always* place these at the end. it should also choose reasonably-sized parameters for all of these.
