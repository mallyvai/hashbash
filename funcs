all funcs are of the form myfunc(num1, num2).
num can refer either to a memory location, or a constant, if 'c' is appended.

saying the following:
loc myfunc(num1, num2)
places the value from myfunc() into 'loc'

unary operators should just ignore their second and third inputs.
binary operators should just ignore their third input.
the ternary "branching" operators should be fine.

program counter is maintained in at mem[2]
constant 0 is located at mem[0]
